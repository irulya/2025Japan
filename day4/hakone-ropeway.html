    <h1>Hakone Ropeway: Feasibility and details for a morning visit</h1>
    <p>The Hakone Ropeway is a “must-see” in Hakone generally, but for your tight morning window, it’s not the best fit. Instead:
Go for Hakone Shrine + Narukawa: 2 hours total (10:00-11:00 AM shrine, 11:10-12:00 PM museum), low-cost (¥7,800 for six at Narukawa), and steps from Ryuguden—perfectly paced for the 1:00 PM shuttle.
Ropeway Alternative: If you’re set on it, take taxis (10:00 AM to Togendai, back by 11:35 AM), budget ¥12,600-¥20,400, and keep it brisk—skip Owakudani lingering. But it’s riskier and pricier than the shrine/park combo.</p>
