    <h1>Hakone Ropeway: Feasibility and details for a morning visit</h1>
    <p>Imagine soaring above Hakone on the Ropeway, with Mount Fuji and Lake Ashi unfolding below. This aerial cable car links Sounzan to Togendai via Owakudani’s volcanic buzz—think steam vents and quirky black eggs. It’s a Hakone highlight, just 1.5 km from Ryuguden (20-25 minute walk or 5-10 minute bus/taxi to Togendai). Operating 9:00 AM-5:00 PM, it runs every 1-2 minutes; costs ¥1,600 one-way or ¥2,900 round-trip (2023 rates, may rise by 2025), or free with a Hakone Freepass (¥6,100 from Shinjuku, ¥5,000 from Odawara).</p><h3>Can You Squeeze It In?</h3><p>You’ve got from 10:00 AM check-out to the 1:00 PM shuttle—about 2.5-3 hours if you’re back by 12:30 PM. Here’s how it could work:</p><ul><li><strong>Return:</strong> 5-25 minutes (taxi vs. walk).</li></ul><h3>Is It a Morning Must?</h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The views are epic—Fuji and Ashi from above, especially with Sakura flair. Owakudani’s volcanic weirdness (steam, eggs) is a unique thrill, and it’s close enough to tempt. A bucket-list ride for Hakone fans!</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> It’s tight—delays (queues of 5-15 minutes, crowded cabins) could stress your shuttle timing. Sakura season means crowds, and costs add up: ¥17,400 round-trip for six (or ¥9,600 one-way), plus ~¥3,000 taxis (~¥12,600-¥20,400 total). Foggy April days might hide Fuji, too.</p><h3>Does It Make Sense?</h3><p><strong>Yes, If:</strong> Go for it if aerial views and volcanic vibes trump quieter spots, you’re okay with a fast pace, and taxis fit your budget (~¥3,000 round-trip).</p><p><strong>No, If:</strong> Skip it if you crave calm, want to dodge crowds or costs, or prefer shrine/park charm—missing the shuttle for this isn’t worth the hustle.</p><p>The Ropeway’s a Hakone star, but your morning’s too short to shine. Opt for Hakone Shrine and Narukawa instead—2 hours total (10:00-11:00 AM shrine, 11:10-12:00 PM museum), ¥7,800 for six, and right by Ryuguden. If you’re dead-set on the Ropeway, taxi it (10:00 AM out, 11:35 AM back), budget ¥12,600-¥20,400, and skip lingering—though it’s pricier and riskier.</p>
