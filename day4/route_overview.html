</p>
<h2>Step-by-Step Route</h2>
<h3>Step 1: From Ōkubo to Tokyo Station</h3>
<p>
Distance: ~5.5 km from Ōkubo to Tokyo Station (Shin-Ōkubo is closer to Shinjuku, but Shinkansen departs from Tokyo Station).<br>
Options:<br>
<strong>Taxi:</strong><br>
Hail a taxi or book via app (e.g., JapanTaxi) to Tokyo Station’s Yaesu Exit (Shinkansen gates).<br>
Time: 15-25 minutes, depending on traffic (Sakura season may add delays).<br>
Cost: ¥2,000-¥3,000 total (base fare ¥730 + ~¥410/km for 5.5 km + traffic).<br>
Notes: Best for six people with luggage—direct and hassle-free.<br>
<strong>Yamanote Line + Walk:</strong><br>
Walk 300m to Shin-Ōkubo Station (5 minutes).<br>
Take Yamanote Line (inner loop) to Tokyo Station (~15 minutes, 7 stops).<br>
Time: 25-35 minutes total, including transfers.<br>
Cost: ¥200 per person × 6 = ¥1,200 (IC card like Suica/Pasmo).<br>
Notes: Cheaper but crowded; managing suitcases on the train and through Tokyo Station’s busy corridors is tricky.<br>
Recommendation: Taxi to Tokyo Station (~¥3,000 total) for convenience with luggage and group size.

<h3>Step 2: Shinkansen from Tokyo Station to Odawara</h3>

Cost: ¥3,500 per person (unreserved ¥3,260, but reserved recommended) × 6 = ¥21,000.<br>
Duration: 35-45 minutes.<br>
Luggage: Overhead racks for standard suitcases; oversized bag goes in reserved space behind last row (book early—limited spots during Sakura season). Arrive 15-20 minutes early to board.<br>
