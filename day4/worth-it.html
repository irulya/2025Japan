    <h1>Is It Worth It?: Morning exploration options near Ryuguden before the 1:00 PM shuttle</h1>
    <p>Yes, it’s absolutely worth staying until the 1:00 PM shuttle if you’re up for a short morning outing. The area around Ryuguden is rich with iconic Hakone attractions, all within walking distance or a quick bus ride, making it easy to enjoy a few highlights without rushing. With six people and no luggage to haul (since you can leave it at Ryuguden), you’ll have flexibility to explore, especially during peak Sakura season when the scenery is stunning. The alternative—taking the 10:30 AM shuttle—means missing out on these nearby gems and spending extra time waiting in Odawara, which offers less in terms of morning appeal unless you’re keen on Odawara Castle (20-30 minutes from the station).</p>
