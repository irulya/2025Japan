Can you arrange a shuttle pickup for us?”<br>Confirm pickup time and location (typically East Exit, near the taxi stand or a designated hotel shuttle area).<br>On Arrival:<br>Exit Odawara Station via the East Exit, look for a Prince Hotels/Ryuguden-marked vehicle.<br>If unsure, call Ryuguden: “We’re at Odawara Station East Exit. Where’s the shuttle?”<br>Arrival: Check-in at Ryuguden (usually 2:00 PM or later; they can store luggage if early).</p><p><h2>Total Estimated Cost<br>Jumbo Taxi to Tokyo Station: ¥2,500–¥3,500<br>Shinkansen to Odawara: ¥20,460<br>Shuttle to Ryuguden: Free<br>Total: ¥22,960–¥23,960 (or ~¥2,500–¥3,500 with JR Pass covering Shinkansen)</p><p><h2>Total Estimated Time<br>Taxi: ~15–20 min<br>Shinkansen: ~35 min (Hikari) + ~15 min buffer for boarding<br>Shuttle: ~40–45 min + potential wait<br>Total: ~1 hour 45 minutes–2 hours 20 minutes (excluding wait time at Odawara)</p><p><h2>Tips for Execution<br>Timing: Leave Ōkubo by 9:00 AM to catch a 9:30–10:00 AM Shinkansen, arriving at Odawara by 10:05–10:50 AM. Coordinate shuttle pickup for ~11:00 AM.<br>JR Pass: If you have one, use it for the Shinkansen (saves ¥20,460). Purchase at Tokyo Station if needed.<br>Luggage: Shinkansen has ample storage; the shuttle should handle all bags easily (confirm with Ryuguden).<br>Shuttle Confirmation: Call or email Ryuguden 2–3 days prior to confirm your pickup time and ensure they know you’re a group of 6 with luggage.</p>
