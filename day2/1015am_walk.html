    <h1>Walk: 1015 AM - Stroll to this 144-acre oasis</h1>
    <p>Walk (1 km, ~15 min): Head southeast from Ōkubo Airbnb to Shinjuku Gyoen’s Okido Gate.</p><ul><li>3 min in - Shin-Ōkubo Edge: Look right—Korean cafes perk up; pastel chairs gleam. More Info (#)<br>Details: This is near Cafe de Kave or a similar Korean-style spot—pastel decor, K-pop on loop. Iced lattes and honey bread are staples; it’s part of the Hallyu boom since the 2010s. The vibe’s bright and modern against Ōkubo’s grit.</li><li>8 min in - Shinjuku Shift: Look left—towers peek over trees; a salaryman rushes by. More Info (#)<br>Details: Shinjuku’s skyline edges in—NTT Docomo’s 240m spire, built 2000, stands out. The salaryman’s a common sight, briefcase swinging; this stretch marks the fade from Ōkubo to Shinjuku’s bustle.</li><li>12 min in - Okido Gate: Look right—park walls rise; blossoms hint through gaps. More Info (#)<br>Details: Okido Gate, one of Gyoen’s three entrances—stone and wood from 1906, Imperial-era. The blossoms are Somei-Yoshino; April 1’s peak means petals might spill over. It’s a quieter entry than the main gate.</li></ul>
