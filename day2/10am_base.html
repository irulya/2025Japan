    <h1>Base: 10 AM - Wake up slow</h1>
    <p>Wake up slow—jet lag kicks in. Grab onigiri from 7-Eleven (300m walk)—rice balls and tea fuel you up. See Koreatown’s bustle outside: BBQ smoke, K-pop posters.<br>Why It’s a Must-See: This is your soft landing into Tokyo—jet lag’s real, and starting with a chill morning in a vibrant neighborhood sets the tone. Koreatown’s energy wakes you up without overwhelming.</p>
