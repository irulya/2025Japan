    <h1>Travel: 1115 AM - Walk back through Ōkubo</h1>
    <p>Walk (1.5 km, ~20 min): Exit Shinjuku Gyoen’s Sendagaya Gate, head northwest through Ōkubo to Himawari Sushi.</p><ul><li>2 min in - Sendagaya Gate Exit: Look right—Gyoen’s wall fades; a vending machine glows. More Info (#)<br>Details: Sendagaya Gate’s a local favorite—less crowded than Okido, built 1906. The vending machine offers Pocari Sweat or green tea, ¥130 each; a kid once jammed it with a petal. It marks the shift back to urban life.</li><li>5 min in - Shin-Ōkubo Station Area: Look left—BBQ joints smoke up; a skewer stall hums. More Info (#)<br>Details: Near Shin-Ōkubo Station, BBQ reigns—Yakiniku House or similar grills ¥100-200 skewers. Last week, a busker sang BLACKPINK here, pulling a crowd. The smoke’s thick with galbi and gochujang.</li><li>10 min in - Okubo-dori: Look right—K-pop shops flash photocards; left, ramen stacks rise. More Info (#)<br>Details: Okubo-dori’s Koreatown central—K-Plaza sells BTS cards for ¥500+. Left, a grocery stacks Shin Ramyun, spicy Korean instant noodles. A fan once traded a rare card for sushi nearby.</li><li>15 min in - Joban-dori Crossing: Look left—Seigaku-ji temple hides; ring its bell if open. More Info (#)<br>Details: Seigaku-ji’s a small Edo-era Buddhist temple off Joban-dori—wooden, understated. Its bell’s rung for peace since 1945; a caretaker might let you try if he’s around. It’s a quiet pocket in the chaos.</li><li>18 min in - Near Himawari: Look right—fishmonger’s stall hints at sushi. More Info (#)<br>Details: A tiny stall—possibly Uogashi—sells tuna scraps or squid near Himawari. The scent’s a sushi preview; a chef once tossed a head to a stray cat locals call “Sushi-san,” now a regular prowler.</li></ul>
