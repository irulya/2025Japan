    <h1>Long Story: 1 PM - 1PM</h1>
    <p>The train hums east, Shinjuku’s glass spires shrinking behind you. At Edo Castle’s East Gardens, you step onto paths where samurai once strode. The moat’s still, reflecting 1457’s massive walls—stones hauled by thousands under shogun rule. Teens scramble up ruins, playing warrior, while adults trace history in the cracks. No castle stands now, just echoes—power, war, and time. Cherry blossoms dot the grounds, softening the past’s weight. It’s raw, real, and free.</p>
