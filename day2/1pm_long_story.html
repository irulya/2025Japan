    <h1>Long Story: 1 PM - Train east</h1>
    <p>The train hums east, Shinjuku’s glass spires shrinking behind you. At Edo Castle’s East Gardens, paths wind where samurai once strode. The moat’s still, reflecting 1457’s massive walls—stones hauled by thousands under shogun rule. Ruins beckon climbers; history seeps from the cracks. No castle stands now, just echoes—power, war, and time. Cherry blossoms dot the grounds, softening the past’s weight. It’s raw, real, and free.</p>
