    <h1>Long Story: 1115 AM - Walk back through Ōkubo</h1>
    <p>The walk back through Ōkubo buzzes—Korean BBQ joints and trinket shops line the way, a mini Seoul in Tokyo. At Himawari Sushi, you slide into seats as plates glide past: ruby tuna for the grandparents, slippery eel for the rest. The chef’s a blur, slicing fish like a samurai. The teens stack plates, turning it into a game—13-year-old vs. 15-year-old—while adults marvel at the freshness. It’s loud, it’s lively, and it’s your first real bite of Japan.</p>
