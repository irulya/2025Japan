    <h1>Long Story - 1145 AM</h1>
    <p>Back at Kyoto Station, you walk southwest to Toji Temple—founded 796 by Emperor Kammu, Kyoto's first guardian when it became capital. The five-story pagoda rises 55 meters, built 883, rebuilt after fires—wooden tiers gleam against the sky, Japan's tallest still standing. Inside Kodo Hall, 15 Buddhist statues from the 9th century stare down, carved for a sect that faded. The grounds hush the city—once a market site, now a calm echo of Heian-era faith. Teens frame the tower; adults catch history's weight. It's Kyoto before the crowds.</p>
