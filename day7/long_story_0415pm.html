    <h1>Long Story - 0415 PM</h1>
    <p>You board the Karasuma Line at Shijo, a quick ride to Kyoto Station—built 1997, its grid-like roof a modern stamp on Kyoto's ancient slate. The subway hums with locals, a contrast to Teramachi's chatter. Back at the station, you walk 300m to Hotel Vischio—Hachijo Exit glows softer now, evening settling in. It's been a day of castles, trains, temples, and trades—Kyoto's layers unpacked. You drop bags, maybe hit a ramen spot nearby, and call it at 6:00 PM—a tight, rich circuit complete.</p>
