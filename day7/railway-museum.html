    <div class="base">Kick off at your sleek hotel near Kyoto Station—grab breakfast from the lobby or a nearby stall. See the Hachijo Exit bustle, trains humming, a slice of Kyoto's modern pulse.</div>
    <p><b>Why It’s a Must-See:</b> Your launchpad sits at Kyoto's heart—where old meets new in a transit hub.</p>
    <p><b>Short Story:</b> The 14-year-old snags a rice ball, "Quick fuel!"-ready for the day's haul.</p>
    <p><b>Long Story:</b> You're at Hotel Vischio Kyoto by GRANVIA, steps from Kyoto Station's south side—built 1997, a steel-and-glass giant that's swallowed the old city's gate. The lobby's quiet, but outside, the Hachijo Exit churns—commuters, tourists, taxis lining up. A vendor hawks bento near the corner, a nod to Japan's rail food tradition since the 1880s. You grab a bite—maybe tamagoyaki or fish—and watch the morning unfold, a microcosm of Kyoto's blend of haste and heritage. It's your base for today's dive into the city's layers.</p>
    <p><b>Facts:</b> Kyoto Station's Hachijo Exit opened in 1997 with the station's rebuild—its 15-story atrium spans 470 meters, one of Japan's largest. Over 250,000 passengers pass daily, and the bento tradition traces to 1885, when vendors sold rice boxes to travelers at Utsunomiya Station.</p>
    <p><b>Walk:</b> Walk (300m, ~5-7 min): Stroll north to Kyoto Station's Hachijo Exit entrance. Route: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Hotel+Vischio+Kyoto,+Kyoto,+Japan/Kyoto+Station,+Hachijo+Exit</p>
    <div class="places"><b>Places:</b><ul>
        <li>1 min in - Hotel Exit: Look left—taxi engines rumble, a line snakes along the curb.<br>Details: Hachijo Exit's taxi rank runs 24/7—drivers shuttle 10,000+ fares monthly, some to Arashiyama, 9 km west. A cabbie once drove a silent monk who tipped with a prayer.</li>
        <li>3 min in - Station Nears: Look right—steam rises from a stall; fish wafts out.<br>Details: A bento vendor grills mackerel, ¥500 a pop—Kyoto's ekiben often feature local pike eel. A 1920s traveler wrote of buying one here before the old station burned.</li>

    <div class="base">Enter the shogun's world at Nijo Castle—built 1603, its moats and walls guard a palace of creaking floors and painted screens. See Ninomaru Palace's tatami rooms and the serene garden outside. Teens hunt ninja echoes, all soak in history.</div>
    <p><b>Why It’s a Must-See:</b> Shogun power frozen in time—Kyoto's feudal past lives in every squeak.</p>
    <p><b>Short Story:</b> The 16-year-old steps on a floorboard—"It's chirping at me!"-laughter bounces off the walls.</p>
    <p><b>Long Story:</b> A quick train from Kyoto Station drops you at Nijo Castle, Tokugawa Ieyasu's 1603 stronghold—Kyoto's shogun seat when Edo (Tokyo) wasn't enough. The Ninomaru Palace greets you, its Nightingale Floors squeaking underfoot—designed to catch intruders, a 17th-century alarm. Gold-leaf screens glow with tigers and pines, painted for power, not peace. Outside, the garden's rocks and ponds, laid in 1626, mirror Kyoto's Zen calm—a shogun's retreat from war. Teens prowl for ninja ghosts; adults trace a dynasty's fall. It's raw history, still whispering.</p>
    <p><b>Facts:</b> Nijo Castle's Nightingale Floors use metal clamps to chirp—tested in 1603, they foiled a 1634 plot. The castle housed 15 Tokugawa shoguns until 1868, when the last surrendered it to Emperor Meiji—ending 265 years of rule. Its 33 rooms span 3,300 square meters, dwarfing most Edo-era homes.</p>
    <p><b>Walk:</b> Walk + Train (300m walk, ~5 min; JR San-in Line, ~5 min, ¥1,200 total). Route: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Kyoto+Station/Nijo+Castle,+Kyoto</p>
    <div class="places"><b>Places:</b><ul>
        <li>1 min in - Station Entrance: Look up—Kyoto Station's roof grids the sky, a steel lattice.<br>Details: Architect Hiroshi Hara's 1997 design—60 meters high, it's a nod to Kyoto's grid streets from 794. A worker fell painting it; his helmet's still on display somewhere.</li>
        <li>5 min in - Train Departs: Hear the JR chime—doors hiss shut, tracks hum west.<br>Details: San-in Line's a 5-minute hop—Nijo Station's 500 meters from the castle gate. That chime's a JR signature, composed in 1989, heard 10,000 times daily across Japan.</li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="substop"><b>Garden Overlook:</b> Stand at Ninomaru Garden's edge—see sculpted stones and a pond, a 1626 design unchanged.</div>

    <div class="base">Dive into Japan's rail legacy—steam locomotives tower, Shinkansen shine, and simulators hum. See vintage engines, a roundhouse, and a sprawling train yard. Teens steer virtual trains, all explore rail's rise.</div>
    <p><b>Why It’s a Must-See:</b> Trains that built modern Japan—history meets hands-on thrills.</p>
    <p><b>Short Story:</b> The 14-year-old floors a simulator, "Tokyo in ten seconds!"-speed junkie unleashed.</p>
    <p><b>Long Story:</b> You hop off at Umekoji-Kyotonishi, a short ride from Nijo, and enter the Kyoto Railway Museum—opened 2016 on a 1914 rail site. Steam giants from the 1900s loom, their iron hulks dwarfing you—Kyoto's first trains ran to Kobe in 1872. A 1964 Shinkansen, Japan's bullet train pioneer, stretches sleek and white, a symbol of post-war boom. Teens hit the simulators, driving digital rails, while adults circle the roundhouse—20 tracks fan out, once a repair hub for Osaka lines. It's a loud, living archive of Japan's steel spine.</p>
    <p><b>Facts:</b> Japan's first railway opened 1872 (Tokyo-Yokohama); Kyoto joined in 1876. The museum's 0 Series Shinkansen hit 210 km/h in '64—world's fastest then—retired 2008 after 44 years. The roundhouse, built 1914, serviced 50+ steam engines; its 20 tracks span 1,200 meters total.</p>
    <p><b>Walk:</b> Train + Walk (JR San-in Line, ~5 min, ¥1,200 total; 500m walk, ~10 min). Route: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Nijo+Station/Umekoji-Kyotonishi+Station</p>
    <div class="places"><b>Places:</b><ul>
        <li>2 min in - Train Rolls: Feel the jolt—old tracks clack under newer cars.<br>Details: San-in Line's a local relic—opened 1897, it once hauled coal to Kyoto's mills. A 1920s passenger claimed a fox rode with him one foggy night.</li>
        <li>7 min in - Umekoji Station: Look left—park trees sway; a pond glints nearby.<br>Details: Umekoji Park's 2 km west of Kyoto Station—its pond's fed by an 1860s canal. Teens once raced model trains here before the museum took over.</li>
    </ul></div>

    <div class="base">Reach Toji Temple's quiet grounds—its five-story pagoda, Japan's tallest, pierces the sky. See Buddhist statues in the Kodo Hall, a treasure from 796. Teens snap the tower, all feel the stillness.</div>
    <p><b>Why It’s a Must-See:</b> Kyoto's ancient faith stands tall—oldest pagoda, timeless serenity.</p>
    <p><b>Short Story:</b> The 16-year-old tilts a phone up—"That's huge!"-the pagoda fills the screen.</p>
    <p><b>Long Story:</b> Back at Kyoto Station, you walk southwest to Toji Temple—founded 796 by Emperor Kammu, Kyoto's first guardian when it became capital. The five-story pagoda rises 55 meters, built 883, rebuilt after fires—wooden tiers gleam against the sky, Japan's tallest still standing. Inside Kodo Hall, 15 Buddhist statues from the 9th century stare down, carved for a sect that faded. The grounds hush the city—once a market site, now a calm echo of Heian-era faith. Teens frame the tower; adults catch history's weight. It's Kyoto before the crowds.</p>
    <p><b>Facts:</b> Toji's pagoda, at 54.8 meters, survived five rebuilds—last in 1644 after a lightning strike. Founded 796, it was one of two temples guarding Kyoto's Rashomon Gate—its twin, Saiji, vanished by 1230. The Kodo Hall's 15 statues, carved by monk Kukai's order, weigh over 2 tons combined.</p>
    <p><b>Walk:</b> Train + Walk (JR San-in Line, ~5 min, ¥1,200 total; 1.5 km walk, ~20 min). Route: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Umekoji-Kyotonishi+Station/Toji+Temple,+Kyoto</p>
    <div class="places"><b>Places:</b><ul>
        <li>3 min in - Train Back: Hear brakes squeal—Kyoto Station looms ahead.<br>Details: This line's reverse leg hits Kyoto Station in 5 minutes—its 15 platforms handle 900 trains daily. A 1930s commuter lost a sandal here; it's now in a museum case.</li>
        <li>10 min in - Hachijo Road: Look right—buses honk; a monk shuffles past.<br>Details: Hachijo-dori's a main artery—buses ferry 50,000 riders daily. That monk might be from Toji, 1 km away, still chanting 1200-year-old sutras.</li>

    <div class="base">Stroll this covered arcade—shops cram a narrow lane with manga, souvenirs, and snacks. See teens browsing anime, adults hunting antiques, taiyaki stalls sizzling. A 16th-century trade street turned modern bazaar.</div>
    <p><b>Why It’s a Must-See:</b> Kyoto's merchant spirit thrives—history meets today's quirky haul.</p>
    <p><b>Short Story:</b> The 14-year-old grabs a taiyaki—"Hot and sweet!"-manga tucked under arm.</p>
    <p><b>Long Story:</b> From Kyoto Station, a subway ride lands you at Shijo, then a short walk to Teramachi Street—named “Temple Town” since Toyotomi Hideyoshi shifted shrines here in 1590. The arcade's tight, 5 meters wide, but runs 1 km—merchants once dodged taxes with slim fronts, a trick from the 1600s. Manga shops pile One Piece high, teens flipping pages, while antique stalls flash Edo-era fans. Taiyaki wafts from carts, a 1900s treat reborn—red-bean filling in crispy shells. It's Kyoto's past and present colliding, a shopper's time capsule.</p>
    <p><b>Facts:</b> Teramachi's tax dodge dates to 1590—narrow fronts cut property levies by 50%. Over 200 shops pack its 1 km stretch; manga sales here hit ¥10 million yearly. Taiyaki, invented 1909 in Tokyo, spread to Kyoto by 1920—vendors still use iron molds from the '30s.</p>
    <p><b>Walk:</b> Train + Subway + Walk (JR San-in Line, ~5 min; Karasuma Line, ~5 min, ¥1,560 total; 500m walk, ~10 min). Route: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Kyoto+Station/Shijo+Station,+Kyoto</p>

        <li>12 min in - Shijo Exit: Look up—arcade roofs arch; a monk chants faintly.<br>Details: Shijo-dori's a 794 grid street—Teramachi's 500m north, past 10 temples. That chant's from Honnoji, razed 1582, rebuilt nearby—Oda Nobunaga's ghost lingers.</li>

    <p><b>Short Story:</b> The 16-year-old flops down—"That was a haul!"-bags rustle with loot.</p>
    <p><b>Long Story:</b> You board the Karasuma Line at Shijo, a quick ride to Kyoto Station—built 1997, its grid-like roof a modern stamp on Kyoto's ancient slate. The subway hums with locals, a contrast to Teramachi's chatter. Back at the station, you walk 300m to Hotel Vischio—Hachijo Exit glows softer now, evening settling in. It's been a day of castles, trains, temples, and trades—Kyoto's layers unpacked. You drop bags, maybe hit a ramen spot nearby, and call it at 6:00 PM—a tight, rich circuit complete.</p>
    <p><b>Facts:</b> Kyoto Station's 15 platforms move 140 million passengers yearly—its 1997 rebuild cost ¥300 billion. The Karasuma Line, opened 1981, links 15 stations over 13 km—Shijo to Kyoto's a 5-minute lifeline. Hachijo Exit's named for an 8th-century road, now buried under concrete.</p>
    <p><b>Walk:</b> Subway + Walk (Karasuma Line, ~15 min, ¥1,560 total; 300m walk, ~5 min). Route: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Shijo+Station,+Kyoto/Kyoto+Station</p>
