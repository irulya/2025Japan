    <h1>Long Story - 0215 PM</h1>
    <p>From Kyoto Station, a subway ride lands you at Shijo, then a short walk to Teramachi Street—named “Temple Town” since Toyotomi Hideyoshi shifted shrines here in 1590. The arcade's tight, 5 meters wide, but runs 1 km—merchants once dodged taxes with slim fronts, a trick from the 1600s. Manga shops pile One Piece high, teens flipping pages, while antique stalls flash Edo-era fans. Taiyaki wafts from carts, a 1900s treat reborn—red-bean filling in crispy shells. It's Kyoto's past and present colliding, a shopper's time capsule.</p>
