    <h1>Long Story - 1045 AM</h1>
    <p>You hop off at Umekoji-Kyotonishi, a short ride from Nijo, and enter the Kyoto Railway Museum—opened 2016 on a 1914 rail site. Steam giants from the 1900s loom, their iron hulks dwarfing you—Kyoto's first trains ran to Kobe in 1872. A 1964 Shinkansen, Japan's bullet train pioneer, stretches sleek and white, a symbol of post-war boom. Teens hit the simulators, driving digital rails, while adults circle the roundhouse—20 tracks fan out, once a repair hub for Osaka lines. It's a loud, living archive of Japan's steel spine.</p>
