    <h1>Facts - 1145 AM</h1>
    <p>Toji's pagoda, at 54.8 meters, survived five rebuilds—last in 1644 after a lightning strike. Founded 796, it was one of two temples guarding Kyoto's Rashomon Gate—its twin, Saiji, vanished by 1230. The Kodo Hall's 15 statues, carved by monk Kukai's order, weigh over 2 tons combined.</p>
