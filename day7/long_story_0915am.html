    <h1>Long Story - 0915 AM</h1>
    <p>A quick train from Kyoto Station drops you at Nijo Castle, Tokugawa Ieyasu's 1603 stronghold—Kyoto's shogun seat when Edo (Tokyo) wasn't enough. The Ninomaru Palace greets you, its Nightingale Floors squeaking underfoot—designed to catch intruders, a 17th-century alarm. Gold-leaf screens glow with tigers and pines, painted for power, not peace. Outside, the garden's rocks and ponds, laid in 1626, mirror Kyoto's Zen calm—a shogun's retreat from war. Teens prowl for ninja ghosts; adults trace a dynasty's fall. It's raw history, still whispering.</p>
