    <h1>Day 1 (03/31/25): Airport To-Dos at Haneda</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arrival at Haneda:</strong> Your Delta flight (DL0121) lands at Haneda Terminal 3 around 1 PM. Disembarking a full international flight with a family of six might take 15-20 minutes, especially if the grandparents move slower.</li>
        <li><strong>Passport Control:</strong> Haneda’s efficient, but lines can vary. For a midday arrival, expect 20-40 minutes. Japan’s immigration is straightforward—fill out arrival cards on the plane, and with no red flags, it’s quick. Six people might stretch it a bit, but you’re not peak-season slammed (Golden Week’s later).</li>
        <li><strong>Baggage Claim:</strong> With six+ suitcases, figure 20-30 minutes. Haneda’s baggage handling is fast, but locating and wrangling that much luggage takes time, especially with teens helping (or not).</li>
        <li><strong>Customs:</strong> If you’ve got nothing to declare (just personal stuff), it’s a 5-10 minute walk-through after a quick bag scan. If they pull you for questions—unlikely with a family—it could add 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash Withdrawal:</strong> Withdraw cash (yen) from ATM.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Connected:</strong> Buy a local SIM card or rent a pocket WiFi.</li>
    </ul>
