    <h1>Day 1 (03/31/25): Dining Options Near Airbnb</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong class="top-level">Dining Options Near 2-chōme-19-9 Ōkubo:</strong> Your Airbnb is in Ōkubo, a vibrant area in Shinjuku known for its Korean influence but also packed with Japanese dining options. It’s near Shin-Ōkubo Station (one stop from Shinjuku on the Yamanote Line) and within walking distance of diverse eateries. Given your group’s preferences—sushi, ramen, eel, and pescatarian needs—here are some tailored suggestions:
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Sushi: Kura Sushi Shinjuku Kabukicho:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location: Kabukicho, Shinjuku (about 1 km from your Airbnb, 15-minute walk or 5-minute taxi) - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=2-chome-19-9+Okubo,+Shinjuku+City,+Tokyo+169-0072,+Japan&destination=Kura+Sushi+Shinjuku+Kabukicho,+1-16-3+Kabukicho,+Shinjuku-ku,+Tokyo&travelmode=walking&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Maps Route</a></li>
                        <li>Why It Fits: This is a popular conveyor belt sushi chain, affordable and kid-friendly. It offers a wide variety of sushi, including fish options like tuna, salmon, and shrimp that suit pescatarians, plus fun extras like tamago (egg) and cucumber rolls for kids. Plates start at ¥100-¥200, and there’s a touchscreen ordering system</li>
                        <li>Family-Friendly: Spacious seating, quick service, and a gimmick where kids can play a game after eating a set number of plates (win a small toy). Open late (usually 11 AM to 11 PM), perfect for your arrival timing</li>
                        <li>Pescatarian Note: Plenty of seafood and veggie options; no need to worry about meat-heavy dishes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Ramen: Ichiran Shinjuku Kabukicho:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location: Kabukicho, Shinjuku (1.2 km from your Airbnb, 15-20 minute walk or short taxi) - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=2-chome-19-9+Okubo,+Shinjuku+City,+Tokyo+169-0072,+Japan&destination=Ichiran+Shinjuku+Kabukicho,+1-17-10+Kabukicho,+Shinjuku-ku,+Tokyo&travelmode=walking&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Maps Route</a></li>
                        <li>Why It Fits: Ichiran is a famous ramen chain specializing in tonkotsu (pork broth) ramen, but you can customize it. Pescatarians can request no pork slices and stick to egg, seaweed, and noodle-focused bowls, or ask about broth alternatives (some locations offer lighter options). Kids love the slurpy noodles and booth-style seating</li>
                        <li>Family-Friendly: Private booths let your group eat comfortably together. Open 24 hours, so it’s flexible for jet-lagged schedules</li>
                        <li>Pescatarian Tip: Double-check with staff for a fish-based broth option (less common but sometimes available) or focus on toppings like nori and green onions</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Eel (Unagi): Unagi Sansho:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location: Near Shinjuku Station (1.5 km from your Airbnb, 20-minute walk or quick taxi) - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=2-chome-19-9+Okubo,+Shinjuku+City,+Tokyo+169-0072,+Japan&destination=Shinjuku+Station,+3-38-1+Shinjuku,+Shinjuku-ku,+Tokyo&travelmode=walking&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Maps Route</a></li>
                        <li>Why It Fits: This spot serves delicious unagi (grilled freshwater eel) over rice, a treat your whole group can enjoy. Pescatarians will love it, and it’s a light yet flavorful option after travel. They also offer side dishes like miso soup and pickled veggies</li>
                        <li>Family-Friendly: Traditional seating with tables (some tatami, call ahead to reserve if needed). Kids might enjoy the sweet-savory eel sauce. Typically open for lunch and dinner (check hours, often 11:30 AM-2 PM, 5-9 PM)</li>
                        <li>Note: Unagi is pricier (¥2,000-¥3,000 per bowl), but it’s a special treat</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Flexible Pescatarian Option: Tonkatsu Maisen (Shinjuku Takashimaya Branch):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location: Shinjuku Takashimaya, 14th floor (1.8 km from your Airbnb, 25-minute walk or 10-minute taxi) - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=2-chome-19-9+Okubo,+Shinjuku+City,+Tokyo+169-0072,+Japan&destination=Takashimaya+Times+Square,+5-24-2+Sendagaya,+Shibuya-ku,+Tokyo&travelmode=walking&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Maps Route</a></li>
                        <li>Why It Fits: Known for tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlets), Maisen also offers ebi-fry (fried shrimp) and katsu-curry with seafood options, perfect for pescatarians. Non-pescatarians can enjoy pork, and kids can have smaller portions or rice with sides</li>
                        <li>Family-Friendly: Located in a department store with a casual dining vibe, it has plenty of seating and a varied menu. Open 11 AM-10 PM</li>

                <li><strong class="second-level">Casual All-Around: Haneda Ichiba Shinjuku:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Location: Near Shinjuku Station (1.5 km from your Airbnb) - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=2-chome-19-9+Okubo,+Shinjuku+City,+Tokyo+169-0072,+Japan&destination=Shinjuku+Station,+3-38-1+Shinjuku,+Shinjuku-ku,+Tokyo&travelmode=walking&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Maps Route</a></li>
                        <li>Why It Fits: This place specializes in fresh seafood—sushi, sashimi, and grilled fish—straight from Haneda’s market. Pescatarians will thrive here, and there’s eel on the menu too. Non-pescatarians can try fish-based ramen or rice bowls</li>
                        <li>Family-Friendly: Bright, welcoming atmosphere with table seating. Open for lunch and dinner (typically 11 AM-11 PM)</li>
                        <li>Tip: Try the kaisendon (seafood rice bowl) for variety</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Practical Tips:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Timing: Arriving around 3 PM, you might want a late lunch. Most places listed are open all day or reopen by 5 PM for dinner</li>
                        <li>Walking: Ōkubo to Kabukicho or Shinjuku Station is walkable (10-25 minutes), but with kids and luggage, a taxi (¥500-¥1,000) might be easier post-flight</li>
                        <li>Reservations: Not always needed, but for a group of 6, calling ahead (or asking your Airbnb host to help) ensures seating, especially at Unagi Sansho or Maisen</li>
                        <li>Budget: Expect ¥1,000-¥2,000 per adult at casual spots like Kura or Ichiran, more (¥2,500-¥4,000) at unagi or seafood restaurants</li>
                        <li>Kid-Friendly Extras: Many spots offer small portions or rice-based dishes for kids. Bring a few snacks from Haneda in case they’re picky post-flight</li>
                    </ul>
