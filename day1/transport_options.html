        <li><strong class="top-level">Recommendation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Best Value:</strong> Limousine Bus + Taxis (9,800-10,400 JPY). Most economical, saving 5,000-13,000 JPY over taxi options. Book for a 2:30 PM departure</li>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Best Convenience:</strong> Jumbo Taxi (21,000-23,000 JPY). Fastest and simplest—direct by 2:45-3:05 PM—but double the bus cost. Pre-book it</li>
                <li><strong class="second-level">Middle Ground:</strong> Two Standard Taxis (15,000-18,000 JPY). Direct and available, but less cohesive for your family</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
