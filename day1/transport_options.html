                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Significantly more expensive, requires pre-booking for best rates</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Two Standard Taxis:</strong> Splitting into two groups for the direct trip.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Details:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Route:</strong> Haneda to 2-chōme-19-9 Ōkubo</li>
                        <li><strong>Travel Time:</strong> 30-50 minutes, arriving 2:45-3:05 PM</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Each taxi is 7,500 JPY (flat rate) to 9,000-10,000 JPY (metered with tolls). Total: 15,000-18,000 JPY</li>
                        <li><strong>Luggage:</strong> Three suitcases + three people per taxi</li>

                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Splits the group, higher than bus option</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Value:</strong> Limousine Bus + Taxis (9,800-10,400 JPY). Most economical, saving 5,000-13,000 JPY over taxi options. Book for a 2:30 PM departure</li>
                <li><strong>Best Convenience:</strong> Jumbo Taxi (21,000-23,000 JPY). Fastest and simplest—direct by 2:45-3:05 PM—but double the bus cost. Pre-book it</li>
                <li><strong>Middle Ground:</strong> Two Standard Taxis (15,000-18,000 JPY). Direct and available, but less cohesive for your family</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
