    <h1>Affordable, High-Quality Clothing in Tokyo</h1>
    <h2>Tsukiji Outer Market (Day 3, 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM)</h2>
    <p><strong>Where:</strong> 500m walk from Tsukiji Station, Chuo City.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Primarily a food market, but some stalls sell packaged goods like high-quality cotton aprons or fish-themed tees—durable, simple stuff. Think ¥500-1,000 for items that last. Not fashion-central, but the quality’s solid for casual wear.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> It’s more about utility than style—practical pieces from a historic market.</p>
    
    <h2>Senso-ji Temple - Nakamise Street (Day 3, 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM)</h2>
    <p><strong>Where:</strong> 500m walk from Asakusa Station, Taito City.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Traditional Japanese goods along a 300m stretch—think handheld fans (¥1,000-2,000), cotton yukata tops (¥2,000-5,000), or sturdy senbei snack bags. Quality’s high due to craftsmanship roots from the 1600s.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Affordable souvenirs that double as wearable art—light, breathable fabrics perfect for daily use.</p>
    
    <h2>Akihabara Electric Town (Day 3, 2:30 PM - 4:00 PM)</h2>
    <p><strong>Where:</strong> 2 km walk from Senso-ji, Chiyoda City.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Anime-inspired clothing like graphic tees (¥500-2,000) and hoodies (¥3,000-5,000) from shops like Animate. Also, techy accessories—LED caps or bags (¥1,000-3,000). Quality’s decent—thick cotton, good stitching.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Budget-friendly for otaku vibes, and the durability matches the price—great for casual, quirky wear.</p>
    
    <h2>Takeshita Street (Day 3, 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM)</h2>
    <p><strong>Where:</strong> 1 km walk from Yoyogi Station, Shibuya City.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Kawaii fashion galore—tees, skirts, and hoodies from WEGO or indie stalls (¥500-2,000). Higher-end lolita dresses at 6%DOKIDOKI (¥5,000-10,000) still feel premium for the cost. Fabrics are often cotton-poly blends, built to last a few seasons.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Trendy, youthful styles at fast-fashion prices—quality’s above chain-store norms like H&M.</p>

    <h1>Extra Tips</h1>
    <p><strong>Secondhand Scene:</strong> Beyond Day 3, Shimokitazawa (not in the itinerary) is a thrifting hub—vintage Levi’s or Japanese brands like Beams go for ¥2,000-5,000. Quality’s top-notch due to Japan’s care for used goods.</p>
