    <h1>Day 5 (04/04/25): Ryuguden to Hotel Vischio Kyoto by GRANVIA</h1>
    <p>Ready to trade Hakone’s serene lakeside for Kyoto’s vibrant Sakura buzz? On April 4, 2025, your group of six will journey from Ryuguden—a traditional ryokan by Lake Ashi—to the modern Hotel Vischio Kyoto by GRANVIA, just steps from Kyoto Station. Here’s your detailed route, blending a free shuttle, a swift Shinkansen ride, and a short stroll, all timed to land you in Kyoto by late afternoon.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Free Shuttle from Ryuguden to Odawara Station</h2>
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> April 4, 2025, 1:00 PM<br><strong>From:</strong> Ryuguden, 139 Motohakone, Hakone-machi, Ashigarashimogun, Kanagawa 250-0522, Japan—a charming Prince Hotels ryokan known for its onsen and Lake Ashi views.</p>

<h3>Shuttle Details</h3>
<p>This complimentary shuttle, courtesy of Ryuguden, whisks you 20 km to Odawara Station, a key Shinkansen hub. The ride takes 40–50 minutes, though Sakura season traffic near Lake Ashi might nudge it closer to 50. You should’ve booked this through Ryuguden’s front desk—confirm it’s set for your group of six.</p>

<h3>Luggage</h3>
<p>Your six suitcases (e.g., 28 x 43 x 63 cm) should fit fine—shuttles typically have undercarriage storage or interior space. Double-check with Ryuguden to ensure they can handle all your bags comfortably.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Odawara Station<br><strong>When:</strong> Around 1:45 PM, barring major delays.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Shinkansen from Odawara to Kyoto Station</h2>
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p><strong>Train:</strong> Tokaido Shinkansen Hikari (Nozomi skips Odawara, so Hikari’s your pick).<br><strong>Recommended:</strong> Hikari 519 leaves Odawara at 2:03 PM, arriving Kyoto at 4:22 PM—perfect timing after your 1:45 PM arrival.<br><strong>Backup:</strong> Miss the 2:03 PM? The Kodama 735 departs 2:13 PM, reaching Kyoto at 4:52 PM (slower, with more stops).</p>

<h3>Duration & Cost</h3>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Hikari: 2 hours 19 minutes; Kodama: 2 hours 39 minutes.<br><strong>Cost:</strong> ¥16,610 per person for reserved seats during peak Sakura season—¥99,660 total for six. Got a Japan Rail Pass? It’s covered, but reserve seats anyway; Sakura crowds are no joke.</p>

<h3>Booking & Boarding</h3>
<p>Book ASAP via JR Central’s Smart-EX (smart-ex.jp) or Odawara’s ticket office—Sakura season fills trains fast. At Odawara, head to platforms 5 or 6 (follow “Shinkansen” signs from the shuttle drop-off). Arrive by 1:53 PM for the 2:03 PM Hikari—line up at your carriage’s marked spot (check your ticket). Overhead racks fit your suitcases (up to 160 cm total dimensions), or stash them at your feet if racks are full.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Kyoto Station<br><strong>When:</strong> 4:22 PM (Hikari 519) or 4:52 PM (Kodama 735).</p>

<h2>Part 3: Kyoto Station to Hotel Vischio Kyoto</h2>
<h3>Route</h3>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> A breezy 200 meters (2-minute walk) from Kyoto Station’s Hachijo Exit.<br><strong>Steps:</strong> From the Shinkansen platform, take the escalators down to the concourse, then follow “Hachijo Exit” or “South Exit” signs. Exit, turn right, walk 150 meters past Kyoto Avanti Mall (on your left), and spot Hotel Vischio Kyoto on your left—a modern haven across from the station.</p>

<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p><strong>Taxi:</strong> Too tired to walk? A 1–2 minute taxi from Hachijo Exit costs ¥600–¥800—plenty are waiting. <strong>Bus:</strong> A shuttle from Karasuma Exit to Hachijo Exit exists (8–15 minutes, 3x daily), but it’s overkill for 200 meters.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Hotel Vischio Kyoto by GRANVIA<br><strong>When:</strong> ~4:25 PM (Hikari) or ~4:55 PM (Kodama), including a few minutes to exit and walk.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Your Journey</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> ~3 hours 25 minutes (1:00 PM from Ryuguden to 4:25 PM at the hotel via Hikari).</li>
    <li><strong>Luggage:</strong> Six suitcases fit the shuttle (confirm with Ryuguden) and Shinkansen racks—no special arrangements needed. Hotel check-in’s after 3:00 PM, so you’re golden; they’ll store bags if you explore post-arrival.</li>
    <li><strong>Crowds:</strong> April 4 hits Kyoto’s Sakura peak (bloom forecasted April 6). Reserve Shinkansen seats now for your group to sit together, and get to platforms 10 minutes early.</li>
    <li><strong>Costs:</strong> ¥99,660 for Shinkansen (free with JR Pass); shuttle’s free; walk’s free (or ¥600–¥800 taxi).</li>
    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Grab bento on the Shinkansen (¥1,000–¥1,500) or at Odawara’s station shops. In Kyoto, Avanti Mall’s food court or Hotel Vischio’s restaurant (breakfast ¥2,000–¥3,000) await.</li>
    <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Expect 12–18°C, maybe rain—pack light rain gear for the short walk.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotel:</strong> Check-in after 3:00 PM, out by 11:00 AM. Enjoy free Wi-Fi, baths, and a gym—rooms are cozy, so consider multiple for your six.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Route Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1:00 PM: Shuttle from Ryuguden to Odawara (40–50 minutes).</li>
    <li>1:45 PM: Arrive Odawara Station.</li>
    <li>2:03 PM: Hikari 519 to Kyoto (2 hours 19 minutes).</li>
    <li>4:22 PM: Arrive Kyoto Station, head to Hachijo Exit.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You’re in Kyoto during peak Sakura (April 6 bloom)! After checking in, taxi to Maruyama Park or Philosopher’s Path (10–15 minutes, ¥1,500–¥2,000) for evening blossom views—lanterns might light the way. If the 1:00 PM shuttle shifts, grab the Hikari 521 at 2:23 PM (arrives 4:42 PM)—confirm with Ryuguden soon!</p>
